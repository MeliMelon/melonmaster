Cookies are awesome. But don't we all know that? I feel really bad for you people out there that are allergic to basically everything in cookies. Eggs, wheat, chocolate, etc. 
Cookies are the best things that ever happened. Yes, even better than sliced bread. Because cookies are the TRUE future of bread. Besides, not all cookies are unhealthy.
Just beacause it has sugar does not mean that it is bad for you. Even the french say, "If it tastes good, its good for you.". 
<br>
<br>
So we already know that cookies are good, but what do we do about it? Sure we can make them and we can buy them at the store, but we shouldn't have to many of them.
after all, we have our health to consider. But what's the solution? Well one answer, live vicariously.
<br>

</div>  
<b><u>Vicariuosly</u>: in a way that is experienced in the imagination through the actions of another person.</b>
In other words, watching someone else do what you want to do, and experience joy from the experience as if you were doing it yourself.
This is a good way of restraining your self from abusing the amazing substance that we call cookies. Only problem is, living vicariously can also work in the opposite way.
With some people this can be considered torture, crazyness, insanity. So for some people, <s>living vicariously</s> is out of the picture.
<br>
<br>
But some people REALLY want to eat those cookies on the counter, fresh out of the oven, wafting the amazing smells that cookies tend to smell like. Also, some people, including myself, have absolutely no self control; and will eat the entire thing in one go, and will have NO REGRETS. So we still have a problem. Specifically, 
we are still eating the cookies. So what other solution is there? Obviously, we don't want diabetes or something of that like but if we eat the cookies (which we will) we will get these 
health problems. Maybe, we could use the medicine that is used to cure people with type 2 diabetes; insulin.
Then again, insulin is probably not the best idea because you have to inject yourself with it. So <s>insulin</s>
is off the table. So we're stuck. Living vicariously might work for SOME people, but its not a permanent solution. Injecting yourself with insulin is probably illegal and DEFINITLEY unsafe,
and if we keep eating these cookies we will develop serious health problems. Or we will skip the health problems and just give ourselves a straight up heart attack. I would suggest hiding the cookies from yourself but you would probably overkill
it and the cookies would never be found again, or found in a decade or 2 and they would be extremely mouldy and sad and you would have ruined cookies. Then your life would be ruined because after you realized that
you couldn't find the cookies you had a panic attack and had to eat a stress-relief cookie. We still need a permanent solution. But what? We NEED to get to the root of our problem. And fast.
Perhaps a therapist? We could go to Mr.Mental's website, but I don't particularly trust him. 
<br>
<br>
So maybe we research our problems ourself. I believe that the root of our problem is located in a very easy to overlook 
but obvious place. The taste. But this is quite stressful. If living vicariously works for you, <a href="cookiespage2.html">Click here for stress-relief cookies.</a> Also, thanks for staying here this long.

Cookies always taste amazing. Key word there, <u>TASTE</u>. So taste is what makes cookies taste good. But what MAKES cookies taste good? Sugar. Why does sugar taste good? Sugar tastes good because it releases a certain chemical in our brains called dopamine. Dopamine is what
makes things tastes good, makes things feel good, it is the happy chemical. It directly corresponds with why you over indulge as well. See, because when you eat the first cookie your brain releases a lot of dopamine, and you feel happy. Then when you eat
that second cookie, your brain releases more dopamine, third cookie more dopamine. You like this because obviously it means that you are happy. So to keep this dopamine up, you eat the entire box of cookies plus 32 more. You feel sick,
horrible, and stupid for doing that, but you are happy. Extremely happy. So the problem here is the dopamine. The dopamine makes us happy, so maybe if we didn't have that dopamine we could control ourselves. But if we didn't have that
dopamine, the cookies would taste more like salad, which is gross compared to cookies. So what do we do? What if we conditioned our brain to release LESS dopamine when eating cookies. It is definitley possible.

</div>
<br>
The obvious first question we should be asking, is what is conditioning our brain to release less dopamine? Well the much abridged version of the explanation is: we make eating cookies less enjoyable. I know, I know, 
its a sad truth. Like seriously, who wants to make eating cookies LESS enjoyable!? I mean, if you have a serious problem you probably would want to, but for the rest of us, this is <b>SAD</b>.  At this point, I <b><u>TOTALLY</u></b> understand
 if you don't want to continue because of this sad truth. If so, <a href="cookiespage2.html">Click here to calm yourself.</a> Still here? GREAT! Or you know, this is sad so its just ok? I don't know. Anyways, To condition our brain, first choose a 
list of 10 things you absolutely HATE, LOATHE, CANNOT STAND. Then rate them on a scale of 1-10. 1 being you just take a deep breath and persevere, 10 being you procrastinate it for 6 months, then you eat 35 cookies and hate your life while you do the task.
Choose the top <b>5</b> items on your list and then, while you eat cookies and or think about them, or perform the task that you hate doing. This way your brain associates the task you hate with doing cookies. DISCLAIMER, it does not always work.
But if it doesn't work, it isnt the worst thing ever. Because if it doesn't work, your brain will associte the task that you hate with cookies, so it will become enjoyable. Keep doing this until you've done all 5 things on your list. Once finished, if it hasn't worked yet, you have a VERY serious problem. 
If it did work, CONGRATS!! You have officialy found a permanent solution to your problem. You may go enjoy.. well I guess at this point you wouldn't enjoy cookies that much anymore... Well then go do whatever it is you enjoy I guess.

The one thing that everyone hates is when you are told that an oatmeal raisin cookie is a chocolate chip cookie. I personally like oatmeal raisin cookies so this wouldn't work for me or anyone else who likes oatmeal raisin cookies. However, if you don't like oatmeal raisin cookies, then you have come to the right place. Replace all your cookies with oatmeal raisin cookies. If that doesn't work.. then   
<div style="font-family: serif;">
<h3 style="border: 3px; border-radius: 4px; border-width: 6px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 205); border-inline-end-width: 850px; border-color: rgb(255, 255, 205);">I'm running out of solutions to this never ending problem so I have one more idea (for now) that we are going to try to use and after that you are on your own with your debilatating cookie addiction.  </h3> 
<h4 style="border: 3px; border-radius: 4px; border-width: 6px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 205); border-inline-end-width: 850px; border-color: rgb(255, 255, 205);">The idea: SOMETHING I READ.</h4> 
</div>
<div style="font-family: Gill Sans MT">
So the idea behind my idea is that, however painful, record yourself saying: I HATE COOKIES! over and over again and then play it while you sleep. Make sure it goes on for a long time and if you can't say it for more than 5 hours, which you probably shouldn't, use a recording editor to make it continue for 5 hours then play it when you sleep. This is my final solution so I hope it helps but this idea isn't guaranteed to work either. So I hope it does help but if not, <a href="cookiespage2.html">Click Here</a> To vicariously live away your sorrows. THE END.
